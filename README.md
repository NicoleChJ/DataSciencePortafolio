# Data Science Portafolio
Throughout my professional journey, I quickly recognized the importance of documenting technical insights, the methodologies I applied, and how they interconnect (I still have my old green notebook). However, it took me longer to appreciate the significance of a well-structured portfolio—not just as a record of progress, but as a means to refine and showcase my expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. This repository not only helps me organize and showcase my knowledge but also represents the comprehensive portfolio I’ve always aimed to create.

As this portfolio evolves, it will serve as a curated collection of my Data Science and Data Analysis projects, spanning academic work, self-directed learning,  to the practical application of skills in professional settings. Some projects are fully developed, others are ongoing, and a few are in the conceptual stage. Due to confidentiality agreements, I will not include proprietary work from previous companies, but I will incorporate generalized insights and approaches that demonstrate my expertise.

*This repository is a work in progress*, and I invite any feedback for improvement.
