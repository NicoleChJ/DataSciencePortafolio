# Data Science Portafolio
Throughout my professional journey, I quickly understood the importance of documenting the technical insights from the techniques I applied and their interconnections (I still keep my old green notebook). However, it took me a while to realize the value of having a structured portfolio to track my progress in Artificial Intelligence. This repository not only helps me organize and showcase my knowledge but also represents the comprehensive portfolio I’ve always aimed to create.

As this portfolio expands, it will serve as a comprehensive record of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have undertaken—ranging from academic assignments and self-directed learning to the practical application of skills in professional settings. Some projects are complete, others are ongoing, and a few are still in the planning phase.

This repository is a work in progress, and I invite any feedback for improvement.
