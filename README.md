# Data Science Portafolio
When I began my professional journey, I quickly recognized the value of maintaining a notebook to document the technical insights of the techniques I was applying and their interrelations (I still have my old green notebook). However, it took me some time to realize the significance of having a structured portfolio to monitor my progress on AI. This portfolio not only helps me organize my knowledge but also aligns my goals with my evolving expertise.

As this portfolio grows, it will serve as a comprehensive compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have completed, spanning academic work, self-learning, and and the practical application of skills in professional environments. Some projects are completed, others are in progress, and a few are in the planning stages.

This repository is continually evolving, and I welcome any feedback for improvement.
