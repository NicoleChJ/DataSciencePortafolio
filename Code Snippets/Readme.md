# Common Code Repository
This folder contains reusable code that can be utilized across multiple projects. The provided code snippets demonstrate how to implement these utilities through simple examples.

## Sections
When building a model, several steps are typically required. Depending on your data, model type, and objective, some steps may require more in-depth processing, while others might be optional. Each folder in this repository contains code specifically designed for a particular stage of the process.

#### EDA
Common code that you use to give yourself a sense of the data.In this section you will find:
- Data Inspection.
- Visualizations for univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
- Statistical Tests.


#### Data Cleaning
Includes standard preprocessing techniques for cleaning datasets and preparing them for modeling based on the discovers done in EDA:
- Usual clean.
- Outliers


#### Feature Engineering
- Feature Scaling: Some machine learning algorithms perform better or converge faster when features are on a similar scale 
- Feature Enconding
- Feature Selection


#### Data Split
