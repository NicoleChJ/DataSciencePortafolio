    "Data splitting is the process of dividing a dataset into separate subsets to train and evaluate a machine learning model. The common types of splits are:\n",

    "- Validation Set: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting\t10-20%\n",

    "* Shuffle: Helps avoid any bias due to the datasetâ€™s original order.\n",
    "* Time Series Consideration: In time-series models, data should not be randomly split but preserve chronological order to prevent future data from leaking into training."
