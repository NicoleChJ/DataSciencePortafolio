    "# Data splitting \n",
    "Is the process of dividing a dataset into separate subsets to train and evaluate a machine learning model. The common types of splits are:\n",
    "- Training Set:\tUsed to train the model\t60-80%\n",
    "- Validation Set: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting\t10-20%\n",
    "- Test Set:\tUsed for final model evaluation\t10-20%\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Considerations:\n",
    "* Stratification: Used for classification problems to ensure the same class distribution across splits.\n",
    "* Shuffle: Helps avoid any bias due to the dataset’s original order.\n",
    "* Time Series Consideration: In this kind of models, data should not be randomly split but preserve chronological order to prevent future data from leaking into training.\n",
    "* Cross valiadation: train and validate folds of the data."
